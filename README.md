# Grain Auger

Declarative dataflow language over Orleans streams.

## Overview

Grain Auger is a declarative dataflow language over Orleans streams. It allows you to define a dataflow graph using a simple DSL and then execute it on an Orleans cluster. The dataflow graph is defined as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is a grain and each edge is a virtual stream. The language is designed to be simple and expressive, allowing you to define complex dataflows with minimal effort and boilerplate.
